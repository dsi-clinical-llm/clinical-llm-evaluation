      "Please note that I am not a doctor or medical professional but will try my best to provide you information from this situation based on what I know of it. It seems like there might be two different issues at hand here - one being a possible bleeding issue in the GI tract which may have led to a hemorrhagic shock (if there were any significant amount of blood loss) as well as potential signs of dehydration due to vomiting. In addition, it appears that your patient has been recently discharged from the hospital following surgery so it&#x27;s likely they are also dealing with other post-operative concerns such as pain management etc.. If we focus specifically on their bowel movements though it looks like they started having &quot;melonitc&quot; poop which can sometimes signal ulcerations in your colon caused by irritants entering into your intestines via food particles or bacteria present within them leading up towards your large intestine where things get even more complicated if these ulcers become infected resulting in inflammation known commonly referred too simply put &quot;diarrhea&quot;. This particular case does seem very serious however because although it sounds unlikely someone could actually die solely off eating something bad without getting sick first unless perhaps they were already suffering severe depression beforehand which would cause extreme weightloss leading onto starvation deaths among others! \n",

      "Generated Summary:\n",
      "An elderly female presents complaining about pain in her lower extremities. She has a history of hypertension, severe aortic stenosis, hyperlipidemia, and right hip arthroplasty. The patient reports hearing a pop followed by immediate onset of pain and weakness of the right leg. She also notes having difficulty breathing since she fell. Her initial vital signs are BP 124/76 mm Hg; heart rate 98 bpm; respirations 15 rpm; temperature 36.7C (98F); O2 saturation 98% on room air. On physical examination, the patient appears pale but alert, oriented x3. Vital sign trends include decreasing blood pressure, tachypnea, increased work of breathing, and mild tachycardia. A cardiac monitor reveals sinus rhythm at 104bpm with no acute arrhythmias noted. Pulse oximetry shows desaturation from baseline levels. Neurologic assessment reveals full motor strength without any focal deficits. Abdominal palpation identifies diffuse abdomen tenderness with guarding. Pelvic examination demonstrates complete pelvis adnexa and uterine size appropriate for menopause. Laboratory studies show normal CBC counts, renal function, coagulation panel, urinary myoglobinuria, serum creatinine, glucose level, and calcium level. EKG is unremarkable except for QRS complexes that appear as narrow peaked waves consistent with inferior MI. Chest X-rays demonstrate multiple pulmonary infiltrate suggestive of pneumonia. Blood cultures grow gram positive cocci. CT angiogram confirms occlusion of the RCA distally at the origin of its major branches and proximally at the LAD ostium due to thrombus formation. The patient is started on anticoagulants, heparin infused intravenously, aspirin orally administered, and nitroglycerin via IV administration. Further diagnostic testing includes a TTE which finds severe aortic stenosis along with severe mitral regurgitation. An echocardiography rules out pericardial tamponade. Given all these findings, we can conclude that this patient’s presentation was likely due to spontaneous coronary dissection involving the left anterior descending coronary artery, causing obstruction to flow. This event is known to be associated with endothelial damage caused by systemic inflammation or other conditions such as smoking or genetic predisposition. Treatments vary depending on severity but often involve medication therapies like antiplatelets or beta blockers combined with procedures such as balloon angioplasty if necessary. In summary, it&#x27;s important not only treat symptoms related specifically with spontaneous coronary dissections but also look into underlying causes so patients have better long term prognoses overall.\n",

Recently she developed signs and symptoms suggestive of acute cholecystitis which included right upper quadrant pain associated with nausea and vomiting along with passage of dark urine and clay colored bowel movements. The most likely cause of her current presentation is a stone in the common bile duct secondary to acute inflammation from her cholecystitis. I recommend obtaining imaging studies such as a helical computed tomography scan or magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatogram of the liver, gall bladder and pancreas with intravenous contrast to confirm this diagnosis. If confirmed it will be necessary to place a percutaneous drain to decompress the gallbladder and allow for resolution of any underlying infection prior to performing surgery to remove these stones. A plan would then need to be formulated to manage her other chronic illnesses simultaneously.\n",

      "The patient is a 79 yoF w/ a h/o CAD s/p RCA stenting, diastolic CHF, 1+ MR, HTN, Hyperlipidemia, previous smoking history, and atrial fibrillation who presents for direct admission from home for progressive shortness of breath. According to Pt, her primary complaint is not shortness of breath, but cough X 1 week which has been rarely productive of white sputum. She denies associated fevers, chills, nausea, vomiting, pleuritic pain, weight gain, or dietary indiscretion. She also reports a sore throat over the past 3 days. She recently underwent thoracentesis for a moderate size pleueral effusion. Cytology of the effusion was negative for malignant cells. Pt denies recent palpitations, and reports that she has been compliant with all medications. She admits to recent fatigue and 2 pillow orthopnea which has been present for months. Current etiology considerations include CHF vs intrinsic pulmonary disease (infiltrative) vs embolic disease. In order to optimize cardic function with atrial kick, pt underwent cardioversion and became hypotensive with a junctional rhythm requiring intubation. She was placed on dobutamine. Off of dobutamine, cardiac monitoring demonstrated a long QTc of 700 and an atrial escape rhythm.\n",

The patient&#x27;s chief concern appears to be the cough as this may have contributed to her recent hospitalization for a right-side pleural effusion, however, further assessment will need to be done in order to determine if there are any other contributing factors such as pneumonia or another underlying cause for her current presentation.  \n",

It would therefore seem appropriate to continue evaluating for potential causes behind her recent development in more pronounced dyspnoeae including both interstitial lung diseases caused by inflammation along with congestive heart failure related respiratory compromise through either obstruction alone or secondary alveolar fluid accumulation.\n",

Upon admission to the hospital the patient&#x27;s neurological exam revealed no focal deficits; however, the patient complained of pain in his mid back region upon attempted movement. Radiographic imaging demonstrated an acute left sided subdural hemorrhage with leftward subfalcine herniation and trans- tentorial extension into the brain stem. MRI revealed extensive bone erosions within the patient’s right temporal area consistent with metastatic disease. The patient received antibiotics due to concern over meningeal invasion from the subgaleal collection as well as intravenous corticoids for symptomatic relief given the patients age and comorbidities.

He had been in unusual state of good health at baseline respiratory status (using 4L nasal canula at rest and 6L with exertion) when 3 days prior to admission, he hugged his cousin who has rats for pets and also the heat came up from the basement of his house. He feels that with these two events, his breathing became acutely worse and he is concerned for allergen exposure. He denies any sick contacts, fevers, chills, rhinorrhea. He did receive flu and pneumovax vaccines. He has had a recent admission last month with progressive dyspnea on exertion. The computed tomography revealed increased ground glass opacity in lower lobes superimposed on pulmonary fibrosis with elevated eosinophils peripherally (12%). A bronchoalveolar lavage was also positive for eosinophils. He was started on high dose steroids (prednisone 60mg) with plan for close outpatient follow up for eosinophilic lung disease. He was discharged on 2-3L nasal canula. He then represented to the emergency department for spontaneous pneumomediastinum of unclear etiology. On day of current admission, the patient called his pulmonologist complaining of worsening shortness of breath since Saturday. Yesterday he was at pulmonary rehab and desaturated to the 70s on 6L with minimal exertion, and he is currently on 4L nasal canula at rest. No sick contacts recently. He was asked to go to ED.

Her initial vital signs are BP 124/76 mm Hg; heart rate 98 bpm; respirations 15 rpm; temperature 36.7C (98F); O2 saturation 98% on room air. On physical examination, the patient appears pale but alert, oriented x3. Vital sign trends include decreasing blood pressure, tachypnea, increased work of breathing, and mild tachycardia. A cardiac monitor reveals sinus rhythm at 104bpm with no acute arrhythmias noted. Pulse oximetry shows desaturation from baseline levels. Neurologic assessment reveals full motor strength without any focal deficits. Abdominal palpation identifies diffuse abdomen tenderness with guarding. Pelvic examination demonstrates complete pelvis adnexa and uterine size appropriate for menopause. Laboratory studies show normal CBC counts, renal function, coagulation panel, urinary myoglobinuria, serum creatinine, glucose level, and calcium level. EKG is unremarkable except for QRS complexes that appear as narrow peaked waves consistent with inferior MI. Chest X-rays demonstrate multiple pulmonary infiltrate suggestive of pneumonia. Blood cultures grow gram positive cocci. CT angiogram confirms occlusion of the RCA distally at the origin of its major branches and proximally at the LAD ostium due to thrombus formation. The patient is started on anticoagulants, heparin infused intravenously, aspirin orally administered, and nitroglycerin via IV administration. Further diagnostic testing includes a TTE which finds severe aortic stenosis along with severe mitral regurgitation. An echocardiography rules out pericardial tamponade. Given all these findings, we can conclude that this patient’s presentation was likely due to spontaneous coronary dissection involving the left anterior descending coronary artery, causing obstruction to flow. This event is known to be associated with endothelial damage caused by systemic inflammation or other conditions such as smoking or genetic predisposition. Treatments vary depending on severity but often involve medication therapies like antiplatelets or beta blockers combined with procedures such as balloon angioplasty if necessary. In summary, it&#x27;s important not only treat symptoms related specifically with spontaneous coronary dissections but also look into underlying causes so patients have better long term prognoses overall.'],\n",

She was found to have a temperature of 96 degrees Fahrenheit, pulse of one hundred twenty beats per minute, oxygen levels of ninety five percent, respiration rates of sixteen times per minutes and systolic pressures of two hundred sixty millimeters mercurial while lying supine. Upon further investigation it was noted that her white count was elevated indicating possible bacteremia. Blood culture revealed growth of Klebsiella pneumoniae. Due to these findings the patient required admission to intensive care unit where she could receive appropriate treatment.'],\n",

Recently she developed signs and symptoms suggestive of acute cholecystitis which included right upper quadrant pain associated with nausea and vomiting along with passage of dark urine and clay colored bowel movements. The most likely cause of her current presentation is a stone in the common bile duct secondary to acute inflammation from her cholecystitis. I recommend obtaining imaging studies such as a helical computed tomography scan or magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatogram of the liver, gall bladder and pancreas with intravenous contrast to confirm this diagnosis. If confirmed it will be necessary to place a percutaneous drain to decompress the gallbladder and allow for resolution of any underlying infection prior to performing surgery to remove these stones. A plan would then need to be formulated to manage her other chronic illnesses simultaneously.'],\n",

A cardiac stress test was performed revealing persistent ST elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). Cardiology was consulted given the severity of his presentation. An immediate percutaneous intervention was ordered which revealed an occlusion in his distal right coronary artery.

If we focus specifically on their bowel movements though it looks like they started having &quot;melonitc&quot; poop which can sometimes signal ulcerations in your colon caused by irritants entering into your intestines via food particles or bacteria present within them leading up towards your large intestine where things get even more complicated if these ulcers become infected resulting in inflammation known commonly referred too simply put &quot;diarrhea&quot;. This particular case does seem very serious however because although it sounds unlikely someone could actually die solely off eating something bad without getting sick first unless perhaps they were already suffering severe depression beforehand which would cause extreme weightloss leading onto starvation deaths among others! \\n        \\n        \\n        \\n        \\n        \\n        \\n        \\n        \\n     ```']},\n",

She has a history of hypertension, severe aortic stenosis, hyperlipidemia, and right hip arthroplasty. The patient reports hearing a pop followed by immediate onset of pain and weakness of the right leg. She also notes having difficulty breathing since she fell. Her initial vital signs are BP 124/76 mm Hg; heart rate 98 bpm; respirations 15 rpm; temperature 36.7C (98F); O2 saturation 98% on room air. On physical examination, the patient appears pale but alert, oriented x3. Vital sign trends include decreasing blood pressure, tachypnea, increased work of breathing, and mild tachycardia. A cardiac monitor reveals sinus rhythm at 104bpm with no acute arrhythmias noted. Pulse oximetry shows desaturation from baseline levels. Neurologic assessment reveals full motor strength without any focal deficits. Abdominal palpation identifies diffuse abdomen tenderness with guarding. Pelvic examination demonstrates complete pelvis adnexa and uterine size appropriate for menopause. Laboratory studies show normal CBC counts, renal function, coagulation panel, urinary myoglobinuria, serum creatinine, glucose level, and calcium level. EKG is unremarkable except for QRS complexes that appear as narrow peaked waves consistent with inferior MI. Chest X-rays demonstrate multiple pulmonary infiltrate suggestive of pneumonia. Blood cultures grow gram positive cocci. CT angiogram confirms occlusion of the RCA distally at the origin of its major branches and proximally at the LAD ostium due to thrombus formation. The patient is started on anticoagulants, heparin infused intravenously, aspirin orally administered, and nitroglycerin via IV administration. Further diagnostic testing includes a TTE which finds severe aortic stenosis along with severe mitral regurgitation. An echocardiography rules out pericardial tamponade. Given all these findings, we can conclude that this patient’s presentation was likely due to spontaneous coronary dissection involving the left anterior descending coronary artery, causing obstruction to flow. This event is known to be associated with endothelial damage caused by systemic inflammation or other conditions such as smoking or genetic predisposition. Treatments vary depending on severity but often involve medication therapies like antiplatelets or beta blockers combined with procedures such as balloon angioplasty if necessary. In summary, it&#x27;s important not only treat symptoms related specifically with spontaneous coronary dissections but also look into underlying causes so patients have better long term prognoses overall.']},\n",

She has a history of hypertension, severe aortic stenosis, hyperlipidemia, and right hip arthroplasty. The patient reports hearing a pop followed by immediate onset of pain and weakness of the right leg. She also notes having difficulty breathing since she fell. Her initial vital signs are BP 124/76 mm Hg; heart rate 98 bpm; respirations 15 rpm; temperature 36.7C (98F); O2 saturation 98% on room air. On physical examination, the patient appears pale but alert, oriented x3. Vital sign trends include decreasing blood pressure, tachypnea, increased work of breathing, and mild tachycardia. A cardiac monitor reveals sinus rhythm at 104bpm with no acute arrhythmias noted. Pulse oximetry shows desaturation from baseline levels. Neurologic assessment reveals full motor strength without any focal deficits. Abdominal palpation identifies diffuse abdomen tenderness with guarding. Pelvic examination demonstrates complete pelvis adnexa and uterine size appropriate for menopause. Laboratory studies show normal CBC counts, renal function, coagulation panel, urinary myoglobinuria, serum creatinine, glucose level, and calcium level. EKG is unremarkable except for QRS complexes that appear as narrow peaked waves consistent with inferior MI. Chest X-rays demonstrate multiple pulmonary infiltrate suggestive of pneumonia. Blood cultures grow gram positive cocci. CT angiogram confirms occlusion of the RCA distally at the origin of its major branches and proximally at the LAD ostium due to thrombus formation. The patient is started on anticoagulants, heparin infused intravenously, aspirin orally administered, and nitroglycerin via IV administration. Further diagnostic testing includes a TTE which finds severe aortic stenosis along with severe mitral regurgitation. An echocardiography rules out pericardial tamponade. Given all these findings, we can conclude that this patient’s presentation was likely due to spontaneous coronary dissection involving the left anterior descending coronary artery, causing obstruction to flow. This event is known to be associated with endothelial damage caused by systemic inflammation or other conditions such as smoking or genetic predisposition. Treatments vary depending on severity but often involve medication therapies like antiplatelets or beta blockers combined with procedures such as balloon angioplasty if necessary. In summary, it&#x27;s important not only treat symptoms related specifically with spontaneous coronary dissections but also look into underlying causes so patients have better long term prognoses overall.'],\n",

Additionally, no mention has been made regarding how well she tolerates activities like walking around the house or performing light household tasks despite having previously mentioned being somewhat &quot;fatigued&quot;. It would therefore seem appropriate to continue evaluating for potential causes behind her recent development in more pronounced dyspnoeae including both interstitial lung diseases caused by inflammation along with congestive heart failure related respiratory compromise through either obstruction alone or secondary alveolar fluid accumulation.'],\n",
